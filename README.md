# 🛡️ AlphaCare Motor Insurance Risk Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis and models developed to perform **Actuarial Risk Pricing** and **Underwriting Strategy** for AlphaCare Motor Insurance. The project focuses on leveraging historical claims and premium data to establish a robust, data-driven pricing framework, utilizing modern statistical techniques like Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).

### 🎯 Key Objectives

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Develop a foundational understanding of data quality, risk distribution, and profitability drivers across the portfolio.
2.  **Hypothesis Testing (Task 2):** Statistically validate key pricing assumptions (e.g., risk variation across provinces, gender, and age groups).
3.  **Pricing Model Development (Task 3):** Build a predictive model (GLM/Decision Tree) to estimate the expected frequency and severity of claims.
4.  **Actionable Insights:** Provide data-backed recommendations on regional pricing adjustments, underwriting restrictions, and marketing targets.
